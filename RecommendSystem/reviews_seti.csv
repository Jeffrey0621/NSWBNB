Of course they do have many years experience running a BnB in Mudgie so they know the drill but that aside , they were welcoming, friendly, and forthcoming. I don't know Sydney and they do - which was they main reason I wanted to stay with an airbnb host. This is a great way to beat the lonely hotel blues, a great way to get that 'in' on local knowledge. A lovely room to stay in, fresh and clean - a wonderful breakfast early saturday morning before my flight home ( for which I appreciate and am eternally thankful) the fluffiest happiest best behaved dog Kenji i have ever met,  I thoroughly recommend these host and their home to all. .

10,11,36,9,"As my first AirBnB experience, this was a magnificent introduction. Vinh and Stuart were superb hosts...and Kenji their Pomeranian, was equally enthusiastic but very well-behaved and unobtrusive. Their three-story terrace house was unpretentiously stylish but with a retreat-like, relaxed ambience, warm and light. The location was fantastically close to the essence of Sydney...Darling Harbour, Bay-side parks, the City, Circular Quay; all within an enjoyable walking distance.

In line with the AirBnB concept I felt the way in which we could share time was rich, informative and very flexible. I could come and go as I needed, enjoyed engaged conversation on occasions or the gift of attending to my own thoughts or activities comfortably as desired....A beautiful balance and repose. They also gave me access to their wifi which was great to maintain my internet commitments.

Even though they were often out enjoying to their own social activities Stuart and Vinh ensured that my son (who was occasionally visiting me) and I, felt entirely at home and even cooked us both a delicious breakfast with organic-market bought ingredients the morning I was scheduled to leave. The previous day we'd shared a walk down to the monthly Saturday morning market by the bay. I benefited too from hearing of their travel experiences and valued the opportunity to ask about their business venture...where they help creative people define and empower themselves to 'Make Tomorrow (Website hidden by Airbnb) much so that I've chosen to use their services!

So in essence...I'm very grateful, enthusiastic and inspired by the time spent with Vinh and Stuart and would highly recommend their 'AirBnB' experience.

They even had a very yummy custard bun for me upon my arrival. I didn't realize it would be so cold in Sydney this time of year and had only brought a thin hoody.  It was so sweet and caring of Vinh to lend me his jacket for the day.  When I returned after all the sight-seeing, we ended up hanging out and talked the night away. Even though we went to bed quite late, they were kind enough to wake up in the wee hours of the morning just to drive me to the airport! Vinh & Stuart made my stay in Sydney so memorable.

Staying at Vinh and Stu's was definitely the highlight of our Sydney trip.
They were the most welcoming and hospitable hosts anyone could ever dream for. Before we went to Sydney, they sent us a very detailed information pack, that even included the best taxi route from the airport to their home! In short, they are the BEST!

The food and beverage they provided was definitely top quality, and their kitchen was simply amazing and oh so fully equipped. After a healthy and yummy breakfast, we are off to a day of sight-seeing (usually planned with the help of Vinh and Stu), and every night when we come back home we look forward to the interesting conversations with them =)

And I can't praise the apartment enough. The location was simply superb, bus stops literally at the door step, heaps and heaps of cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the Fish Market!! As you all can see from the photos, they have an absolutely breath-taking apartment. And let me tell you a little secret - the apartment is exactly as gorgeous as the photos are!

If that wasn't enough, I must confess that we seriously considered smuggling Kenji back to Melbourne with us... Hmmm... He is without a doubt the sweetest pup in the entire world. Extremely well behaved, he never barked once, and he just loves to cuddle and cuddle.

It seems impossible to compare a basic Sydney motel room that would cost considerably more, with Maria’s luxurious 1 bedroom apartment.

The apartment is nicely furnished and equipped and has a balcony off the main bedroom and another off the living space.  I appreciated the quiet setting in a leafy street in North Sydney.   

North Sydney is a nice place to base yourself if you have activities on the north side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, or a quick and wonderfully scenic train trip from North Sydney station over the harbour bridge to the city.  I’m not sure of the walking time to North Sydney train station but there were also regular buses.  I had a car so really appreciated the security car parking space within the building. 

Maria couldn’t have been more helpful, generous and thoughtful.

In the second bedroom the light is blinding that appears through the crack of the wooden blinds as soon as the sun rises.

The apartment has two flights of steep stairs to the entry just incase you have  bad knee problem like I do.

Take your own hairdryer as I asked for one and couldn't find it. It would appear the owner lives there as all the wardrobes and any other area of the apartment are crammed with paperwork, dusty ornaments and shoes and stuff sprawled out.

Only good point about this place is that it's a ten minute walk to the amazing beach where you can get away for the day and try to forget about the unpleasant place you will encounter when you return.  Nicolette was away in Cuba so not really much help or communication during our stay. Nicolette sounds like a lovely person and made contact before she left so no issues before we arrived. Perhaps she is not aware of AirBnb's standards of renting out your property. I hope they can clean up their act for future guests. It seems like Nicolette was making a quick buck while she was away. I am now in my second place on this trip and the contrast is astounding.  I use Airbnb all over the world and this was not up to cleanliness standards.

On Crystals recommendation we bought all our presents in Paddy's market..that was so much fun and a great experience. We ate fresh fish on the harbor and ate ice cream by the ton. Once Brian had advised us how to get around with the train and the ferry it was easy peasy and NOT at all expensive...Sunday was a particularly reasonable day to travel.

detailed notes on their house, its location, and on how they could be contacted. Check-in was at 6pm, but as I had an early engagement, Vinh went out of his way to adjust his schedule so that we could meet earlier in the day.

The house is easy to access. It's less than a 10 minute walk from Darling Harbour, and 30 minutes from Central Station. From the kitchen there is a pleasant view out onto the bay.

The house included a good size kitchen, where I was free to use a broad range of breakfast items, or indeed, help myself to anything in the fridge.

There were two bathrooms, one used by Vinh and Stuart, and the other reserved for guests (as there was another person staying in the house, the guest bathroom was shared). The guest bathroom was on the ground floor, was clean, and had a great shower.

The bedroom I stayed in was on the top floor of this three-story terrace home. The room was large, and offered a view onto the bay. It included reverse cycle air-conditioning and a television. The bed is a sofa bed. Although I found it acceptable, I suspect it may not have been particularly comfortable for two people (thin mattress that tended to sink into the middle). The room did not have a door, and although visual privacy was guaranteed, as Vinh was working late into the night, light from the floors below did filter into the room.

I was able to use their wireless internet connection, and they had a large range of DVDs and books that I was free to access.

The guys had a cute and well behaved little dog named Kenji.

I did not get to meet Stuart, but did speak with Vinh on several occasions. He was friendly, fun and helpful.

Michael is a very open and helpful host.  We appreciated his lecture to begin the rental clearly deliniating how to deal with different aspects of living in the house to ensure there were no troubles nor problems especially after the rental ended.

Described as a luxury apartment, the price surely is! 
At such a price, one would expect everything impeccable (the apartment is worth it), mostly if one stays a whole week. The apartment lacks proper service and maintenance:
- 2 light bulbs did not work when we came in and we had to ask Edan to replace them
- silverware, plates, pots and pans are of poor quality and insufficient quantity to organize a dinner with 8 people. No tablecloth, no napkins. BarbQ on terrace in bad shape.
- probably lack of regular cleaning in the kitchen where we observed blats.
- door windows to the terrace of poor quality
- the unlimited internet is actually very limited and it is too bad we had to put pressure on Edan to fix it. This should not happen.
- finally, Edan should propose a cleaning lady even if at extra-cost and a safe box.

567,559,584,9,"What a stunning house! They say they've been in it for about 10 years but feels like it was built yesterday. Phenomenal view with lovely hosts. The location is great if you want to be close to Sydney, but far enough away to enjoy the peace, quiet and even the stars! A great opportunity for travellers and locals alike...

There's plenty of restaurants an easy walk away, giving you a taste of a variety of delicacies, plus a supermarket, liquor store and the like... We enjoyed some delicious Thai on our visit, which we had delivered and put a movie on to enjoy the comforts of the location, and were treated to a light breakfast from our hosts in the AM.

The layout of the house essentially provides you with your own floor and bathroom, if you're staying in one of the two double rooms, or one single room downstairs. So plenty of privacy. I brought a few members of my family along in this instance, to celebrate my Dad's birthday, and it was the perfect place to do this.

Getting here via public transport is easy - there are several buses that head here direct from the city, and then it's an easy walk up to the house. But do know it's a long bus trip. A car would be preferable. Walking down to the beach is naturally just as easy, so here's hoping for good weather for you! Unfortunately ours wasn't the best but it was still beautiful.

Micky's place is lovely. He has excellent taste and everything was well appointed. I stayed with my parents and the rooms were both quite comfortable. There was every amenity you'd need, clean kitchen, easy to use washer dryer, and comfy beds.

The true star of this place is the neighborhood, it is literally steps away from great bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. I tried to explore Sydney and visited several other neighborhoods, but Surry Hill and Micky's location in particular kept pulling me back. 
Other things to consider: 
The bathroom lights are a bit wonky because they are timed so they go off quite frequently. Also the wifi was a bit spotty, turning off at random times, but if you restart it, it usually comes back on, no problem.

The exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work (no reply from John to two SMS) and there was no  rail or hook in the bathroom for towels, nor anywhere to put soap in the shower. John said he would refund the cleaning fee but this has not happened.

Also we were charged $199 more than quoted, which we tried to sort out with Cathy before arrival, to no avail. At checkout we showed John our paperwork and discussed it with him and he agreed we had been overcharged, said he was ""not trying to rip us off"", he would sort it out but to give him a couple of days to organise a refund. He also thanked us for leaving everything perfectly clean and tidy. After 8 days we have not heard from John or Cathy.

The flat was well-appointed with modern equipment but was not functional.

Security - The building itself isnt safe, there is no gate and the doors are unlock so anyone can come in anytime 

Noisy - it can be very nice because of the traffic in the back street and if you turn the airco on you are not able to listen the tv unless it is extremely high volume! 

Mosquitos - they come from everywhere specially from the BROKEN windows in the bathroom

Heat - if is a hot day you cant stay indoors  even with the fans (there is 2, one was so dirty that I didnt even tough it)  and the  airco on it is just impossible!

The house is at a tranquil location on the foots of Royal National Park at Kirawee. On a rainy day, you feel like you are at a hill station. At morning the birds will wake you up at 7.30 AM and in the nights you will hear crickets. A true bush stay experience. You get the home as you see in the photographs and won't find any spots in the home. John and Maryellen are perfect host. On the day of my arrival, they welcomed me with a drink and offered me a ride to show around the suburbs. The studio kitchen has serials and other supplies for your breakfast. For other light cooking, they had a electric pan. Also please be aware the home is 14 minutes walk from railway station and  if you are not used to walk, it will be difficult. But for us it is OK. I will definitely recommended it to my friends.

And thanks to John for dropping me over the station on my check out. It is a very memorable stay and thanks a lot.

Since John and Maryellen don't have much experience in using Sydney public transports, I would like to give some ideas

If you are coming from overseas and want to go to Kirawee, there are two options

1) Get a train ticket to Kirawee. It is not a direct train. You have to go to Wolli creek and change at Wooli creek. This may be the direct way, But I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons. One, there is a airport railway station access fee of $15 and it would be costly for someone who is on their limited budgets. Secondly between 4.00 PM to 6.00 PM there are no trains to Kirawee that stops at Wolli Creek station. Otherwise it is OK.

2) The other way around is, get a 400 bus that goes to Burwood and get down at Rockdale. The bus stop at Rockdale is in front of railway station. And get a train to Kirawee from Rockdale. I would recommend to get a myzone 2 or 3 ticket for a week/ month if you don't have your own car. The ticket will give you unlimited travel on Sydney suburbs except airport stations on train, buses including airport stations and all ferries for the period of one week / month based on your purchase. The tickets are available at the railway station counter at the airport. But please mention you don't need station access while purchasing for this option.

Pleas feel free to contact me if you need any information.

1260,1250,1275,8,"Rolmar's apartment is in a very convenient location in the heart of Sydney. The check-in process was relatively hassle free. It has floor to floor security (basically, your key will get you to your floor only, plus communal areas) and it is high enough to block out most of Oxford St noise. It's within walking distance to some great cafes, shops and luxury grocers (like Thomas Dux on Crown St)

The apartment itself is probably best suited for short-term stays (we were there for almost three weeks) as it is incredibly small and the photos are a little misleading in that respect. There's not much bench space for cooking and we found that we had to use the back of the couch to balance plates on. The kitchen utensils need a major overhaul, we had to buy a spatula and the tongs were on their last legs. We found these issues to become proper nuisances the longer we stayed ( so this might no be an issue for someone only staying for the weekend)

We felt the apartment was too furnished for how big it was and the gigantic TV radiated so much heat that we needed the sliding door open when it was on. Although, it was very nice to watch a movie on. And again, it was because we stayed there for a long period.

Places like Hyde Park, Chinatown and QVB are just a few minutes walk away and Bondi Junction and the Opera House are also near via public transport.  Rolmar is also very good at communication and his House Manual is sooooo comprehensive telling you everything from checking in and out, use of keys and security access, Wifi internet access and use of appliances including TV and washer and dryer, and even restaurant tips.

The place itself is pretty well-equipped with a big TV, Tivo, stove and oven, toaster, kettle, even a sandwich toaster, nice one!  It also has a great gym and pool and a spa which are open until late at night.  Rolmar's apartment faces a quiet street so at night, you feel like you're living in the suburbs without that city noise, but with all the benefits of city living, including 24 hour fast food joints and convenience stores just on the corner.  I felt kinda spoiled having access to two big groceries on opposite corner blocks and various eating choices even late through the night.

Checking in wasn't a problem as Rolmar keeps total contact via AirBnB upon check in, as he himself said he had one problem before with the previous building manager, but he has now rectified that to make the check in process smooth and seamless.  The place is comfortable enough for one to two people living in it.  Rolmar's flat is very clean and the bathroom was spotless!  The neighbourhood is nice, safe and friendly.

Only one bathroom was a bit of challenge for our family of 5 but we managed around that. One small annoyance with me was the wet bathroom floor when you step out of the shower... and it was not only this place but almost every place I've stayed outside of US and Canada. Somehow, the simple but effective concept of a shower curtain is lost on the world. I would have loved a squeegee type of tool in the bathroom to get it dry quickly. Also had some issues with entry into the building and the locks... but there is a back door which comes in handy. 
I am not going to take points off for those things. I loved the place.
Bondi Junction station was a 10 min walk and there were some buses near the house but we never used those. Bondi Junction station  got us where we needed to go.
Another note to the travelers visiting Australia... We were visiting Sydney during the Easter weekend. A bad time for being a tourist as it was hard to find places that would be open during the weekend... specially, food places. The area around Joe's place had restaurants but most of them were closed for that weekend... which meant we had to make sure we finish our meals in the city itself before venturing back to the suburb... and which is where they will hit you with a Holiday surcharge on your bill :-(.

The location was great too, a short walk down to the beach and about 25/30mins to Manly Wharf, but there is a bus stop directly outside and one slightly up the road.

1446,1435,1460,9,"Michelle was a good host. She is very friendly and cheerful and was quick to reply to my questions through airbnb messages even before we arrived. When we did get there, she was kind enough to pick us up from the bus stop so we wouldn't have to walk up the hill to the house with our luggage. It was great having a full kitchen to cook our own meals while there, and having a washer to wash clothes, and it is true you can see the ocean from the house (and binoculars might be fun if you're looking for whales from the house - to see them that much better than you already can). The 'library' has lots of books of all kinds if you want to pick something to read and I enjoyed waking up to the sound of the local birds singing every morning. 
The space is one floor of her home, but its completely separate from the rest of the house with its own private access like a duplex. We definitely felt like we had our own space, but Michelle and her son were always nearby if we needed anything.  

We had expected to spend more time hanging out at Michelle's place but ended up going into Sydney nearly every day, which meant we spent a lot of time traveling to/from the city. Its about a 10 minute walk to the bus stop and then an hour or so bus ride into the city, which wouldn't be bad if you only do that once or twice. If you want to spend a lot of time exploring the city you might want to stay closer. For those wanting to relax away from the city and enjoy the northern beaches area and some bush walks right outside the house, this is a great spot! 
Related to hanging out and relaxing though, my only negative might be that there isn't a nice comfy couch in the space - only wicker ones which I don't find very cozy (though there was a nice fuzzy blanket to curl up in - that helped). 

All in all it was a good stay. Michelle is wonderful to work with - great attitude, quick responses, friendly and easy to work with. She was eager to offer suggestions and to answer any questions we had. I couldn't ask for a better host.",FALSE,9,9,9,9,9,9,9

She had us visit the house thouroughly from the basement (washer & dryer) to our room on the second floor, opening doors everywhere, explaining where to find anything we need. Then she took us to the grocery store by car, to buy food and wine for the New Year's Eve picnic/party. She offered to bring us with her, her coloc and a couple of friends to look at Sydney's magnificent fireworks from Balmain, which we accepted for sure.
 We had a shelve reserved in one of the fridges, and one in the pantry. We could use the expresso coffee maker with coffee  and milk furnished by Natasa. The kitchen renovated,  is very nice and well equipped, and we could use anything freely. Having our coffee on the terrace with Tabatah was much appreciated. The bathroom, also renovated, was perfect, and tough we had to share it with our hostesses, it was no problem at all.

It is also a very short walk to beautiful Elizabeth Bay and Rushcutters Bay.
Sarah was flexible with our check-in and check-out times and she was prompt to reply to messages and enquiries, which made the booking process easier. 
The only drawback was the noise coming from the works in the neighbouring building, which would start at 7am, but I guess that should only be a temporary issue, and it didn't stop us from enjoying our stay. Also, if you have a car, finding a parking spot is not very easy. Sarah kindly provided us with some hints, but we still had some trouble since we wanted to park the car for long periods of time.

I stayed in the flat by myself over the weekend, and felt safe and secure. There is cctv cameras in the lane behind so that helped a lot. Fluffy white towels...4 actually, thick white sheets and plenty of hanging space made the bedroom really pleasant to sleep in. At times it was a little hot, being the end of summer, but no problem, just turn on the fan and it was cool again. 30 seconds from the fountain was unreal, and if you were a smoker, 30 seconds to the park were your alowed to smoke. Parking is a tiny problem but between 6.00pm and 8.30am weekdays ( after 12.30pm weekends) you can park in the back lane right behind the flat. You just have to be a bit quick! We parked our car in the car park over the road for 48hrs at a cost of $60.00, we thought that was pretty good.

There is a kitchen with a dishwasher and a washing machine, very comfortable bed with lovely linen, TV and ceiling fans. 
I stayed there for four days and it was close to perfect. Jesse made sure that I found the place, which took some time due to very unusual numbering of the houses; then he called again to check that everything was going ok. 
The only drawback was a building site next door with the workmen starting at 7am on weekdays. Nothing that earplugs could not fix but I would not want to stay in the flat whole day with drills and banging going on next door.
Overall, both the cottage and Surry Hills are great spots - central but much more pleasant than an anonymous hotel room in the city.

I was an Airbnb virgin, so was Taylor. I had no idea who he was but I liked the look of his flat & his very open & detailed profile. I could tell we share similar values & principles from his profile already. I was deciding between a whole apartment on Crown Street and rent a room from Taylor. He came across very respectful, considerate & positive in our email exchange, so I decided to rent his room instead as it'd be more fun to have a flatmate during my business trip.

I landed Sydney with little sleep and the sky was grey. When I was welcome by Taylor's bright eyes & big smiles, I felt relaxed & warmed up immediately. The apartment was bright & airy. 'My' room was lovely & cozy, bed was comfy made with fresh new sheets. The large white marble bathroom attached to the bedroom is what every girl needs! 

I was alone in Sydney for 2.5 weeks business trip with few firends in town. Taylor made me feel real at home. He was always consideate with noise whenever I need early night during the week. The location is ideal, I could just walk down to Crown Street for yoga & organic grocery within 10 mins. There are numerous trendy cafes & restaurants for eating out. He was one of the most giving & considerate person I met in Sydney. I felt so looked after by this perfect flatmate! I would not stay in hotel again after my awesome stay with Taylor. My problem now is that I wish my permanent flatmate at home in as cool & fun as him! I feel lucky to have a great friend in Sydney now.

Ken's home is beautiful and huge for us 6 pax. There are 2 rooms downstairs with 1 bathroom and 3 bedrooms upstairs with 2 bathrooms. The view of the neighbourhood and ocean is so breathtaking especially in the morning while u sip your coffee at the beautiful dining place facing the sea. Occasionally you will get beautiful colourful birdies on the balcony! 

The house comes with a pool table too which is awesome for family activity during the winter! That was definitely a bonus for us. The kitchen is well equipped for us to whip up our own meals. There's even a BBQ pit for those interested to BBQ on the balcony.

It was winter and extremely cold during our visit (especially for us Asians), and the house only had 1 common heater upstairs in the living area. But Jackie (ken's daughter) was so accommodating to send another heater over the very next morning. it definitely helped us warm up at night. And we loved the starfishes on the bed and towels as decor. We felt so welcomed and it definitely set the mood right.

This place is HIGHLY recommended for a relaxing getaway. The beach is nearby (best to drive to the beach than walk) and small town with the necessary shops and etc. The ground flr could use a lil bit vacuuming though, but we understand maybe 'cos they live upstairs most of the time. And we wish the WiFi signal is stronger upstairs as the router is placed downstairs. But I'm sure Ken will get that sorted out. ;)

Just a note for those interested, the house is located at a steep hillside. Hence, it is not recommended to check in at night (like we did!) as the area is very dark and very very steep. Maybe it will be great if Ken could put up some driveway lights to the garage ;) That would definitely brighten up the beautiful house even more.

1748,1729,1754,8,"Our stay at Maria's beautiful property was enjoyable from start to finish.  The rooms were spotless and full of thoughtful detail.  We loved her house and we could tell that she loves it too.  The kitchen was modern and fully equipped. The bathrooms appeared very new, and were at a standard similar to that of an upmarket hotel.  The decor throughout was fresh and simple, so it was easy to feel at home.  

The open layout was perfect for a beachside Sydney holiday. We loved preparing meals in the spacious kitchen, or on the barbecue, with the sliding glass doors wide open for a free-flowing space from the outdoors to the living room, kitchen, and dining areas.  Well-placed mood lighting in the garden and inner atrium made this enjoyable at night too.

Bronte had always been our favourite Sydney beach suburb since we lived in Sydney ourselves some years ago.  It's a medium-sized beach that's great for families (no pubs and less busy than nearby Bondi).  Bronte park in itself is another attraction for families.  The kids could choose every day between two playgrounds, the beach, or the ""Bogey Hole"" - a shallower swimming hole protected by a natural tide-breaker of rocks - like a saltwater kiddie pool.  From Maria's house, it's a short and pleasant walk through the park to the beach.

Tamarama Beach is also nearby, and accessible by walking along a particularly dramatic seaside footpath (Tamarama Marine Drive), which reminded us of a grand corniche along Sydney's own riviera.  Some of our other favorite spots in the neighborhood were Cafe Favoloso, which was around the corner; and Bondi Fruitology, a short walk away on Bondi Road, alongside other useful shops for groceries and takeaway food.  

The house is also located at a cul-de-sac with a green patch of trees and grass at the end of it, which makes it quieter and more private than the nearby road, even though the road (and the bus stop) is a few paces away across the green patch from the front door.  The proximity of the bus stop made it easy to access the commercial district of Bondi Junction at any time, so everyone in our group could easily choose themselves from day to day between shopping and dining or outdoor activities. 

Maria even offered us access to a well-stocked pantry and complete kitchen, so we just had to choose our own fresh ingredients in order to cook what we wanted. We appreciated her thoughtfulness at foreseeing small details, like making sure we got oriented with the bus and the various shops and eateries within walking distance, providing us with beach towels and toys for the kids (so we didn't have to pack our own), and even asking if we wanted to have a Christmas tree up for the holidays.

1755,1734,1759,9,"Mitch’s apartment was the perfect spot for me and my partner’s one-week whirlwind tour of Sydney.  The two-bedroom apartment had everything you could possibly imagine and more and it definitely felt like a ‘home away from home’ – just what I needed after travelling all the way from London!  I arrived at Sydney Airport at 5am and Mitch kindly arranged an early check in time for me.   Kitted out with all mod cons, the apartment was extremely comfortable and was a fantastic place to cook in on the odd occasion.  Mitch was a great host who produced a handy guide on how to use all the appliances in the apartment and  provided a list of fantastic local places to eat out.   The apartment is placed in a perfect location to access trains, buses, ferries or to walk to prime locations.  As Darlinghurst comes to life at the weekend, the nightlife buzz is a 10-minute walk away, however,  the apartment is set back far enough to experience peace and  tranquillity if relaxing and chilling out is more your thing after a busy day of walking or sightseeing.   Mitch was easily accessible by mobile/text to address any queries that I had during my stay and I must not forget to mention the lovely welcome chocolates and beers that helped to kick start our holiday indulgences!

Some of the coolest cafés and restaurants on offer in Surry Hills, if not Sydney, are all within walking distance; and, yet, Micky's pad was tucked away inside a quiet alley off Crown Street.

Refreshed in the morning, we'd pull up the overhead shade, and the room will be bathed in natural light—and sweetness. Always a great start to the day.

Walking to Coogee, Gordon’s Bay, Clovelly and Bronte beaches and onwards to Bondi is magnificent. The local buses are reliable and take you to great places. One day I caught a train to the Blue Mountains and followed Scott and Natsuko’s further recommendations for a great place to eat. I loved the local coffee places and discussing brews with Scott.  One evening I was tired and snacking, when Natsuko invited me to share the delicious meal she’d just made. On another, Scott brought home a portion of tiramisu he’d made for a barbeque with friends as he knew I’d love to taste it. Every morning, there was delicious yoghurt, fruits and real coffee.

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.

Alison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...
By the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. 

What can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. 

Felt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). 

Now the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)

2022,2002,2027,8,"We stayed at Funky Newtown Home for 12 nights in Feb. We were 5 adults travelling from Ireland. The house was well equipped for the stay. It is advertised as 4-5 adults and Melissa kindly set up an extra air bed for the 5th adult. Melissa ensured bread, milk, cereal was left for us on our arrival as we came late after a long flight. 

We chose the house primarily on location. The house was very well located in terms of access to services, e.g. 5 minute walk to St. Peter's train station, 5 minutes to large supermarket and 5 minutes to Sydney Park. 

The house was well equipped with utensils, towels etc. There is a cosy living space. We spent 12-15 hours per day out being tourists therefore we cannot comments on things such as the television etc. as we did not use it. 

A few points to note:
The 2 bedrooms upstairs are only separated by a curtain therefore no privacy for guests. 
The Wifi is advertised as free however, prior to arrival we were told we could only use it for a maximum of 2 hours per day. This did not bother us significantly as I said we spent the majority of time out of the house. 
The house was not as clean as I expected it to be. I know a cleaner came prior to our arrival but I have to say under beds and in corners of the house gathered visible dirt. The BBQ was also very dirty and therefore unusable. 

However, our main concern with the house was a tenant living in the Garden Studio who got access through the house. We were informed prior to our arrival about his presence but not informed he would get access to the house. This concerned us greatly as we booked an entire home for privacy and security. He turned out a nice fella but the situation was distressing as he often arrived late at night and we returned on many occasions to an unlocked front door. This would certainly put us off coming here again. 

We ended up very disappointed it turned out this way. We had great enthusiasm for this house and if we had of not had the issue with security and privacy we would have considered returning to this house despite the cleanliness and bedroom concerns. 

Prior to making a reservation, I would advise that you communicate with Melissa about the occupancy of the Garden Studio. ",FALSE,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

The space itself is a nice and extraordinarily tidy and clean apartment with a homey feel, which is supplemented by the host's willingness to show you around some of the coolest parts of the city (including a fair few places left out of most tourist guides). The room I stayed in was nice and spacious and I had my own large bathroom with a shower, washer and drier included. I stayed for two months and felt very much at home.

For those wanting to stay in the area, there are numerous nice cafes, a convenience store, a pizza take away (great calzone) and other useful places all quite figuratively on the doorstep.

The unit was clean and cosy. The interior was original and soothing: house plants, rugs, paintings, old-style furniture. The house was always cool, it did not get hot even in the hottest days. 

There was a veranda with access to a charming shady courtyard. Sometimes we had dinner at a small table on the veranda, and it was a real pleasure for us and especially our children who used the yard as a playground.

The kitchen was neat and tastefully decorated. It had all the necessary crockery and cooking utensils.

When we arrived, we found comfortable mattresses and clean linen prepared for us in the bedrooms. It was very important, as we were able to immediately relax after a long journey.

Renata and Nathanael helped us navigate around their place by making a map with a plenty of helpful hints and tips. It saved us a lot of time and efforts. Detailed instruction manual for the unit also greatly facilitated our comfortable stay. We are feeling really grateful for this help. 

We had wonderful neighbours who were very attentive and helpful, but quiet, unobtrusive and tolerant (we have two ever running and shouting children). At one point they even invited us to a barbecue in the Centennial Park nearby, where we had a great time. Thank you, dear neighbours!

In the house there lives a loving, well-mannered and unpretentious cat. All we had to do is giving her some dry food twice a day. She was very patient and not aggressive at all: even when the kids were playing with it, we could have a peace of mind.

Ratih is a great host.  When we arrived she took the time to show us locations on the map of the tram and bus stops, the grocery stores, the bottle shop, the fish market, among others.  I think we called her once to let her know a package had arrived and on our departure she helped us get a taxi.

The apartment is very convenient for going to the Fish Market, an experience in itself, walking down to the boardwalk for a run along the water, walking to Darling Harbour to walk along the restaurants and shops and to listen to music.  Or to take the ferry to Circular Quay.  We even walked to the Circular Quay and the Rocks and walked back.  Great way to work off the food and drinks for the day.

2185,2173,2198,8,"My wife and I stayed and Penny and Leon's two-bedroom terrace house (with 1.5 bath) in the Inner-West suburb of Glebe during a month-long work assignment in Sydney, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay from beginning to end. The house is the end unit of a row of houses that shares a common terrace of herbs and vegetable plantings, and is located mere steps away from a Light Rail station, which is visible from the house and takes you to Darling Harbour in less than 10 minutes, and Chinatown/George St. in less than 15 minutes. Glebe Point Road is a two-minute walk up the hill, with buses to all major stops including Circular Quay, and ample conveniences like the city library, grocery stores, bakeries, and restaurants. 

The house is on a one-way street that forms a cul-de-sac in a residential block, which means peace and quiet. The back of the house is on a north-facing slope and gives a clear view of Sydney’s downtown. A small courtyard and a skylight brings in plenty of light and airiness into the space. The two bedrooms are on different levels. The downstairs bedroom opens onto the sunny terrace where you can sit and enjoy the view, or hang dry the laundry. The upstairs bedroom gives a better view of downtown because of added height. The owners have decorated the house tastefully with an eclectic collection of antique furniture, textile, and various pieces of art and photography. A small study is stocked with a sizable library of books and a cozy couch. 

The kitchen and bath are completely modern and fully equipped, with all mechanics in good working condition. We arrived in winter, but the gas heating was powerful and we never had any problem with climate control. The washer and dryer are next to the bathroom. 

Leon and Penny kindly allowed us the free use of cooking necessities like cooking oil, spices (Penny stock more varieties than a small store), nuts, jams, etc., and gave us clear instructions on how to use equipment like the oven, dish washer, etc.. Topping this, Leon has compiled a ‘bible’ with names and phone numbers of importance when something breaks, or we lock ourselves out. He also several pages of good suggestions for things to do locally and in slightly more distance suburbs. 

Leon and Penny were very easy to deal with throughout, before and after our occupancy. They always answered my e-mails promptly, and were extremely reasonable in all aspects. My family and I could not have asked for a better place to enjoy our four weeks in Sydney.

Robyn: Couldn't have asked for a better host. Robyn was very prompt and informative, gave clear directions to the house, location of keys etc.

All in all a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend to others.

The apartment was exactly as depicted and clean when we arrived.

There are grocery and liquor stores close by for those who want to cook at home, or a variety of restaurants. Cameron gave us two sets of keys and offered a parking space which we ended up not needing.

The apartment is small but comfortable - we appreciated the queen sized bed since we're both tall. As the weather got warmer (we had an usually warm Dec with some days around 35C), it got a bit hard to sleep at night, as there is no A/C, only a fan; leaving the windows open meant it could be a bit noisy as it faces onto a courtyard with balconies and patios on all sides, but generally this was not an issue. There is a good TV and internet, we had no trouble working at home or contacting family by (Hidden by Airbnb) etc. There were a few minor things that could be fixed - a blind in the dining area doesn't work, the screens need a few repairs etc - we brought them to Cameron's attention.

We wanted a relaxing getaway free from the typical resort venue and the Curly Surf Shack was the perfect ticket. The couple of days when it rained were not a problem because we took full advantage of our wonderful and tastefully decorated apartment to lay around, read our books, cook, sip wine and listen to the surf.

We arrived and where greeted by Joy and her brother  with a warm and welcoming smile. We where shown the apartment given keys and away we went. The apartment itself is spacious, clean and very bright and breezy. It far exceeded our expectations. The unit it totally self contained, Everything we needed was there. The view from the master bedroom out to the ocean is spectacular. The area itself is also fantastic, everything is within walking distance.

Joy was such a fantastic host, always contactable and always smiling and willing to help out where needed. The only regret we have was not being able to stay in Sydney longer. We would have loved to have joined  Joy for a BBQ in the beautiful back yard!!

I thoroughly recommend this unit for all its values, The host, Location, price etc. 

Thank you Joy for making our holiday such an excellent experience. I hope someday we can come back to visit!!!!

Each year, we travelled another destination and missed Sydney New year eve fireworks. This year, we planned just a fortnight before, and Sydney holiday rentals of independent and large sizes get booked 6 months in advance. Tanya had just made up her mind first time ever, to rent her beautiful and loving home. I just somehow noticed and booked with her. We were very concerned about renting somebody's HOME, and so much emotionally lived for over (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) years since childhood. 
We are a world traveller with experience of renting over 250 holiday homes worldwide; were too jittery till we reached at her house. An old, beautiful and spacious bungalow, with so much of love spread all around. every corner contained memories. And how generous of Tanya. so well stocked kitchen. By heart. The house has large garden overlooking 2 golf courses (you can see people playing ), A huge marina with boats and mini cruises sailing on one side and Ocean touching Bondi Beach. What a view. My 16 year young son and his classmate friend were so free by that they did not use the family car for asking me to drop them or pick them up. Everything was so close that both of them enjoyed a ball of a time independently.

The house is clean and tidy and the room is a decent size.  She has all the utensils you need if you like to cook rather than eat out.  The place is northside but very close to the bus station so you can be in the city in 10-15 minutes.  So don't be put off by the fact that it isn't walking distance to the city (although you can walk from Sandra's house over the Harbour Bridge to the city in about 50mins - I did this to and from work a fair bit).  There are also lots of bars and restaurants within a 10-15 minute walking distance.  There are beautiful walks around such as down to Cremorne Point - a beautiful part of Sydney.  I would recommend it as a good place to stay.
In terms of constructive comments, Sandra is very clean and tidy so if you are not one to clean up after yourself regularly then perhaps this isn't the place for you.  I also think the room is really only big enough for one person so if you are a couple and staying more than a few nights it might be too small. 
The only other thing I'd say is there was no television which didn't bother me that much as I was working during the week but as I was doing a longer term stay it does mean you can't just chill out on a Sunday night and watch TV or a movie and I like to watch the news and stuff which I couldn't do on my laptop because the wifi is limited.

2774,2757,2782,8,"500 Words are not enough to compliment about this stay. Airbnb must permit more ways of expression for such fantastic stays :)
There cannot be a better place than this in Sydney, we (Me and my wife Vidhi) are totally convinced about it. Susan and Chris are a wonderful host and you simply feel like home while with them and at the same time you get your complete privacy in the entire lovely studio apartment at your personal leisure. The facilities in this private studio apartment are so minutely well thought of, that you just cannot ask for anything more for entire stay. The apartment is indeed a 5 star facility, no less. Whether it's the choice of variety of options in continental breakfast that are well stocked in ample by Susan, the cool swimming pool, the beautiful garden overlooking entire apartment from the huge french windows in the bedroom, the soothing bathing tub in a well architected bathroom, the nice kitchen with full range of utensils for trying your hands for cooking or the super comfy bed, the elegant dining table right outside in gardern area if you wish to have breakfast outside in morning and everything else house has to offer - the entire home made us feel spoilt completely. 
The home is close to Airport and city both, and a direct bus to city, 301, is just a cake walk ! The bus stop to get this bus to city, ""King street after Maloney street"" is the stop name, is hardly even 100 meters away. There is also a convenience store right outside on king street when you come out from meridian street, that is open till late night. Mascot station which is just about 3 km away takes you directly to Airport (International Airport is just 2 stations away) or city (In about 15 mins to Circular Quay) without having to change the trains. 
Regarging locality, There are a range of local and other restaurants on botany road and gardener's road, both these roads being just about a km walk away.
Waking up to the pleasant sound of birds chirping makes a good start for the day.
There is a lovely and super clean coogee beach as a nearby attraction, that's where we headed to on our first day right after settling down and checking into the apartment after getting a warm welcome from Susan. 
Coogee to Bondi walk along the coastal path is a very famous activity for tourists and locals.
The surroundings nearby are so tranquil and peaceful that you will feel blessed to get such a place to relax in.
And yes, Thanks for spending some time over the coffee with us, Susan! We loved it.

There is a quiet and peaceful balcony which hasn't showed in photos yet. That's my favourite spot! The double bed  is comfit for two people to sleep and I also love the sheet Jan provided:). Shower was really good and toilet was very clean, btw I love the lemon flavour hand wash. There is no air con at moment,  but it wasn't hot at the end of December and  there are two windows in the bedroom.  It  is cool enough for two people to sleep. But you may bring some insects repellent to keep few mosquitoes away. Lucky I didn't bothered by the mosquitoes because I asked Jan in advanced. 
Unit is located at Crown St and closed to CBD. There is a bus stop only 1 minute's walk and many busses pass by. Taxi to CBD is under 10 bucks, form Surry Hills to domestic airport around 30 bucks.  Surry Hills is also a lovely place for tourists to explore. It got lots of  popular coffee shops and independent shops.
Before I arrived there, I thought the place would be a bit noisy, because the map shows that it's beside a busy street. However, surprisingly, when I got into the unit and closed the door,  it is really quite and the whole place was filled with sun shine, which made me feel like escaping from the busy reality  and bursting into a peaceful world.

The second bedroom has two single beds, which can be arranged into one double bed. There is a second shower and toilet in the first floor, which also houses the washer and dryer. My husband and I stayed in the master bedroom and our friend stayed in the second bedroom. The second floor has a well-equipped kitchen, a dining table that sits up to six people, and a spacious lounge that opens into a balcony. There’s an iMac for watching TV, as well as for internet use, and a printer that can be used for tour vouchers, boarding passes, etc. There is also a toilet at the second floor. 

While we didn't get to meet Gwen, she made sure that we have everything we need. There was a folder with detailed instructions on how to use the different appliances, a map indicating places of interest (Cafes, restaurants, supermarkets, bus stops), a list of contact numbers (taxi, her sister and neighbors – in case we need anything urgent). The fridge was stocked with bread, butter, jams, juices, milk and even wine – all available for our use. Gwen made sure we felt at home.

Wifi is a bit slow though. Quickest way to connect with the internet is to use the iMac. 

The place itself is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, close to bus stops. It’s a quick bus ride to the city. A few blocks away is Darling Street which is a commercial strip filled with shops, cafes and restaurants. 

It takes a day or two (or three?) for Gwen to respond to inquiries, but when she does, she makes sure she addresses all questions and concerns. Don’t be disheartened if you don’t hear from her right away. Trust me, her place is worth it.

Gary's idyllic terrace home is situated in the heart of Paddington just off of Oxford St and is well suited for those who love shopping, pubs, trendy cafes, Saturday markets and Sydney night life. 

We were two couples staying in this place visiting family in Sydney and we had everything we needed for a lovely affordable long weekend stay including fresh towels, linen and access to the pantry.The Bedrooms both had queen/double beds which were perfect for two couples and was more than idyllic for friends and young couples. Decor was cool and trendy and felt very much like Sydney in a nutshell. Stairwell was narrow but that was definitely the charm of this terrace place.

Cleanliness wasn't an issue as Gary made sure to have cleaners in before and after us and thoroughly addressed this point to ensure the house was in good condition for guests.

We didn't get to meet Gary, but with his quick and thorough responses via email and SMS, all we needed to do was to start enjoying Sydney the minute we got there.

Beautiful Art Deco building with a cosy appartment filled with lots of details like retro furniture, old school radio, statuettes, designer lamps, other decoration elements and books. There are also a huge supply of towels, bed sheets and kitchen ware and other small and useful things. And the cherry on the cake is a rooftop terrase with a view on CBD and equipment for sunbathing or bbq. It's a public zone but I didn't  seen anyone there during the week I stayed at the place.

Great for one of two guest, three is also comfortable.

Hugh McCullum is a very comfortable host - booking and other organizaitional questions were set easily and quickly. I guess Hugh is also very helpful with introducation of the city and cafes/restaurants suggestions I just prefer to make everything on my own.

So I wish you to have a nice stay here or at other's Hugh's flats which are also very nice and have their onw benefits and atmosphere aspects.

Try great ROOM10 cafe just behind your bulding with always lively atmosphre and crowds around it - I don't like sandwiches but these ones are special - best for breakfast and morning coffee.


Remark:
Before I choosed this place I have made a some research staying in three different hotels recommended by tablethotels in central area: CBD, Darling Harbour and Woolloomooloo bay and also making morning runs so I examined Drummoyne, Balmain, Darling Harbour, Elizabeth Bay as well. In my opininom Potts Point/Woolloomooloo is the best area to stay in Sydney for the first time - with its great natural (real) atmoshpere of the city, selection of restaurants, cafes and shops and 15-20 minute walking to CBD area (that good to visit and  to have dinner but not for living) through the beautiful Royal Garden and great NSW Art Gallery in its center.

Personally, this part of Sydney is my favourite and I tend to stay the vicinity usually. Apt multinational restaurants on King St which is minutes walk away, such a hip yet relaxed neighbourhood. A massive park across the road is very handy as well. Transportation wise, I used mainly the station 2 minutes walk away which got me to the CBD in about 7 minutes ride.

There is a clothes dryer is in the apartment but no washer.  If you need laundry done you give Morag your clothes & she’ll return them washed for you to dry.  We expected & prefer to do laundry ourselves & as needed so this was a bit of a disappointment.
The air conditioner is a portable unit with a hose that has to be placed outside.  This would have been fine except that there is no dedicated window for the exhaust so you have to leave the 3 meter (8 ft) sliding doors open about 15 cm (6 inches) for the exhaust hose which let bugs in, stopped the portable unit from being able to dehumidify & could only cool the open concept livingroom/kitchen so much; the hose is shown in the pics but we didn’t realize how it worked.   The bedroom only had a fan.

It was clear that Morag has taken the time to provide special, homey touches in the apartment, from the Nespresso machine to the delicious-smelling candles. The only comment I would make about the apartment is that it is so beautifully appointed, it may not be the best place to stay with very young children (our youngest is 10 months). Morag left a very helpful guide to the neighborhood and city, which we referred to before each day's adventures. The neighborhood itself is great for walking to the CBD, Kings Cross, and the Jewish Museum area.

And, on the day, there was another SMS to confirm all about our booking with a hotline for urgent issues.

Finally when we entered the house, all of us agreed that it is actually better than what we saw in the website. It was clean and bright from the parking place to the bedroom. And, of course, the best thing was the fantastic view from every corner of the house, personally I really liked the Bali-style sofa-bed facing down the sea.

Walking to the beach was not that easy for my two year old boy but it was fun for the rest.

Exceeded my expectations on every level.
Bet and Keith were the perfect hosts and had all the low down on the local area - eating, transport etc. Extremely professional, welcoming and knowledgeable.
The accommodation is spotlessly clean with absolutely everything you would ever need. 
On arrival Bet and Keith showed me how everything worked in the property. There is a telephone intercom to their house so if you have any queries they are readily available. 
The property is absolutely beautiful with polished wood floors, high ceilings, plenty of light, fresh air, as well as air- con and heating. There is also a washing machine and dryer. What a bonus that is!!!  
There is a large screen TV with an excellent DVD collection. Excellent fast and free wifi connection.

Shopping is easy in BD and you don't have to carry your groceries very far, to and from the bus.
Bronte beach is a nice beach to spend time away from the party-crowd at Bondi. You can swim in a sheltered pool i the weather is rough.

The view are awesome! What i can say is...the apartment and the view and surrounding are awesome!!! The surrounding are quite till you can hear the bird sound very clearly. Let's get started with few topics here

From/To the City (CBD):
- Is about 30-40min to go the city by bus.
- From there you easily to take trains to go anywhere

Attraction:
- About 10min (by bus), you may visit to Koala Park Sanctuary. The entrance fee about 23aud... this park you may go in to the kangaroo area and you may feed and touch them. There's a lot of kangaroo around you. 
- About 2hrs++ ( by bus and trains), you may reach to Blue Mountains! Please dont forget to be there. The view are AWESOME!!!! PLEASE VISIT THERE! 
-About 30 - 40 mins(by bus), you may go to the Opera House, Sydney Bridge, Shark Boat Jet and more attractions around thr CBD.
-About 1hr++(by bus), you may reach to Bondi Beach! You must be there. Very beautiful beach!!!
-About 30-40min (by bus), you may reach to Paddy Market, Chinatown and all the branded bags in shopping mall.
- So, what i can say is even stay out from the city, you still may reach to all attractions and famous place.

Food:
-(For Muslims) - They have ""HALAL"" food near the  apartments. Just walking distance about 8mins, you can get Thai Food, Indian Food, Vegetarian Food and Asian Food. Dont worry even you stay out from the CBD, you still can get Halal food.

DON' DO! :
-After 22:00pm (sydney time), please dont make noise at all.. because all the neighbour will sleep at that time.
- There's 1 day that me and my friends were chit chat and laughing at night.. then later at 12midnight there's a police came to our apartment and said to be quite and not to make noise.
-the neighbour will report to the police or they will come over to tell you to keep quite.

Owner:
- I dont have the chance to meet Estelle due to she's in France that time. So we meet Christiane her aunt....and Christiane are a very nice and friendly person. She are so funny. Love to have a talk with her. She will help you in any way if you need help.

And.... dont feel scared with the duration of travelling between the places from the apartment as you dont feel it far away due to you will enjoying with the view surroundings!!!

Pls dont forget to buy a multi weekly card(is about 63aud), so u can get in to Bus, Trains & Ferry. Much more cheaper!

Thats all about it.

Thanks Estelle and Christane!!!

With Love,
Ermila -MALAYSIA-

The house was exactly how it looks in the photos and was very well kept. Estelle clearly likes to bring small little things from her vacations to decorate the house and has done a very good job of it. 

In addition, when we found a rental place, she was kind enough to help us move all our things from her place to the rental place, doing two rounds in her car. She helped us carry the luggage and was extremely extremely nice in offering us to stay for an additional night when she found that we did not yet have a mattress at our new rental place.

Super comfortable bed, stylish linen sheets, great feather quilt and comfy pillows. I slept like a dream! The location quiet (this is important as lots of Bondi is noisy), the house is in a quiet end of the street and very very pretty.

The room was lightfilled with a wonderful breezes to knock back Sydney humidity. Full length mirrored doors (super handy) and loads of storage space and hangers.

The walk to Campbell Parade - exactly 5 minutes add another minute and you're on the beach! The home is located near the Bondi to Tamarama Coastal  walk - an absolute must.

EVERYTHING Bondi is conveniently located and within a 10 minute walk.
Its a 4-5 minute walk to the bus stop (if that) and only took me an easy + cost effective 50 minutes by public transport from the airport....

Shopping arena with Coles, easy fruits, Westfield's are just 10 minutes by walk & Train station is 5 minutes away. Weather was brilliant so taking a walk around anytime was a liberating experience.

I raised my concerns immediately with Prestige Property but, as it was 8.30pm at night when I arrived there wasn’t much to be done, so I cleaned the worst / most offensive areas of the apartment myself that night and refused their offer to send in (presumably the same) cleaner to go over the flat again the next day.

The location is awesome, the concierge staff are fantastic, but I wouldn’t stay here again.

Some of the finishes in the (relatively expensive!) apartment are very average ... old second-hand-looking cooking equipment, unfinished doors all swollen and splintered at the bottoms, drawers full of random old cast-off ‘stuff’ like knives and strainers and broken chopping boards. the whole building being re-carpeted and noisy street works outside for which no discount was offered.

Dealing with Prestige Properties online wasn’t terrific before my trip. I made a mistake and booked the property for the night before I arrived in Sydney so when I realised my error, two weeks out, I asked to change my booking and applied for a refund for that unnecessary first night.  It took ages and quite a few messages with them to wrestle a (legit, within-Ts & Cs) refund out of them and they originally said they’d only refund it if they were able to re-let the property for the night I was cancelling, which is in contravention of their own cancellation policy, so just make sure you hold letting agencies on Airbnb to account, and check the fine print in all your bookings, folks!

Overall I’ve given the property a ‘good’ rating because: the concierge staff on site were all awesome, the location is fantastic, the property (although not as expected and not clean enough) was well-appointed (mostly), had a very comfortable bed and INCREDIBLE views.

Checking in instructions were fairly easy and the place was easy to spot. The apartment doesn't have a name though so you do have to look out for the building number carefully, which proved ever so slightly challenging at night. However, the penthouse is amazing with unobstructed views of both Bondi and Bronte beach from different parts of the house, and a lovely balcony to enjoy the views and sea breeze from. Furnishings were in mint condition, and the place was immaculately cleaned when we arrived; the beds and linen were all top notch and comfortable as well. If you're going to cook, the kitchen is very well equipped utensils-wise, but you may need to get your own oil, condiments, paper towels etc. Hopefully, the pasta and olive oil we left behind will come in useful for future travellers. Everything else you need is provided - laundry powder, softener, shampoo, dishwasher tablets, plastic bags, ziplock bags, toilet rolls (you may need to purchase some of your own if staying for more than a week though!), iron, dryer etc.  

The apartment is just by the Bronte-Bondi coastal walk, and within walking distances to both Bondi and Tamarama beaches and all their fabulous eateries. There was a bus stop just a short distance away but we never got the chance to use that since we'd rented a car. The garage, as Victoria informed, was indeed too narrow for our 8-seater so we simply parked in front of the garage - no issues there at all.

The only downside is that if you've got crawling babies or toddlers just learning to walk, the stairs may prove to be a bit of a challenge when it comes to safety. Also, the door to the master bedroom doesn't close tightly so we had to make sure our eye was always on the door so our daughter didn't scramble down the stairs herself :) Also, the floorboards meant that neighbours below us could hear little Robyn running across the living area; we had the lady below come up to tell us to nicely watch out for that :/

The unit was clean, and there was plenty of hot water, clean towels, and good water pressure in the shower.  Washer and dryer worked well too.

The bathroom was fairly clean but my mom did clean and scrub the sink and counter on our first morning which made a noticeable difference. The door to the bathroom had no latch or lock but this worked ok for us as we all were all aware of it. If the door was shut, we knew someone was in it. The shower was good and had lots of hot water available.

Both bedrooms were big and comfortable. We all slept well on the beds and a variety of pillows were available to choose from. 

We used the kitchen quite a lot during our stay as we cooked and ate dinner in on two occasions. The kitchen had everything we needed but we were disappointed by its lack of cleanliness. We had to wash every dish, pot and utensil before we used them as we found everything from dust to dried on food on them. It seemed like whoever cleaned the kitchen before our arrival did not do a thorough job.

Other than the kitchen, the only other issues we found were minor. Some lamps had no bulbs so the living area got a bit dark after sunset. There were also no fly screens on the windows so we were left to use the AC to cool the place (the AC did work very well). The door to the laundry is also partially blocked by a shelf so using the washer was a bit challenging.

My family is vegetarian and we were concerned that Bondi would not have a lot of vegetarian options, but before the trip, Olivia recommended multiple places where we could eat and even sent me a link to a blog describing all the amazing vegetarian options in Sydney. Bondi has some incredible food! As for Olivia's house, we absolutely loved it! It had such a homely vibe to it! My parents stayed in the master bedroom upstairs which opens up to a lovely balcony. There is also an upstairs bathroom. We spent most of our time in the living room which was perfect for relaxing after a long day of walking around! The downstairs bedroom was where my brother and I slept. It had a bunk bed which surprisingly fit my brother who is 6'1! There was ample closet space for us to unpack and an AC in the room if it ever got too hot. Thankfully, the downstairs portion of the house was very well ventilated and provided for cool summer nights! There is also a spacious downstairs bathroom where Olivia left us beach towels! Since we were in an air bnb we decided to cook at home and Olivia's kitchen was perfect for that as well! Her kitchen opens up to a backyard with a magnificent vegetable garden. Olivia was gracious enough to let us use her garden. We love spicy food so we tried some of her chilis which were delicious! Also, the grocery store was only a 10 minute walk away! In terms of transportation, you can either take the bus, metro, taxi, or uber into the city which only takes 15-20 minutes tops and is inexpensive. Since I was with my family, the cost of an uber was the same as taking the train into the city but was much more convenient so we ubered around more than anything else. We tried taking the train in once, and the main stop into Syndey was only three train stops away from Bondi Junction (we chose to uber to Bondi Junction). Olivia was a great host and answered all of my questions before the trip. She recommended things to do within the city and around Bondi which kept my family and I busy for the 6 days we were there.

Location was perfect. 3 minute walk to Gordons bay for a snorkel or 5 minutes in the other direction to Coogee beach for a swim. I went for a swim every morning before breakfast then got a cold press juice or coffee on the way back. Some nice cafes and restaurants around Coogee. The pavilion was really fun. Transport was easy to catch the bus to Bondi and then we walked back along the cliff walk.

4651,4668,4693,9,"Period 12 - 30 of November 2015.
We started our three-month-trip to Australia at the nice home of Nicki and Steve. It is located just between the famous Bondi Beach and Tamarama Beach with 10-15 minutes walk to either of those two beaches. It is only a couple of minutes from the bus that takes you to the city in about 30 minutes. In other words it is a perfect location to start exploring Sydney with all its famous attractions.
Nicki is a very vital, joyful and warmhearted person who gladly guides you to interesting places, giving all kinds of practical advice for getting as much as possible out of your stay. During such a long stay as 18 days we felt almost like being part of the family. Good access to kitchen, pool, bathroom dining table etc. made up for the size of the room which didn´t easily provide for a small table and a comfortable chair. The bed was good and comfortable. A stay with Nicky and Steve is definitely a good choice for a couple of weeks in the fairly expensive but beautiful and fascinating city of Sydney.

4652,4651,4676,8,"We had a really great stay at this apartment.  Location and access to public transportation is key when you are traveling and this place has it!  Located close to Circular Quay, it's where you want to be in Sydney.  It's also easy access to public transport as Wynard Station is only a few minutes walk.   Also, George street is a major street with lots of buses running (including the hop on and off explorer bus) and you're also about a 15 minute walk to the ferries.  Grocery store is also across the street.  The apartment was nice, clean, and comfortable.  It was plenty of space for four people.  The kitchen has everything you needed.  The second room is technically a study so it isn't completely closed off but is partially closed off by a room divider screen.  However, it wasn't really an issue  because the room is separated from the rest of the rooms in the the apartment and the one  side of the study that is open, only opens up to the hallway so you don't necessarily see into the study unless you are in the hallway so it's still pretty private.  The apartment is on the first floor, so you may want to use curtains for more privacy.  The air conditioning is on a timer so it turns off after a certain amount of time and you have to get up and manually restart it.    Probably only an issue if it's super hot. However, there are two tower fans that are provided in the apartment.  I think the only window that opens is in the master, but it doesn't have a screen and opens to a small, but cute common courtyard (though not really a big issue because it didn't seem like many people really use it).  It seems this apartment is privately owned by a rental company, but technically the rest of the building also serves as a hotel for the other rooms.  So there a nice lobby and also a restaurant downstairs.   I liked that they also provided tourist materials on Syndey in our room.  The apartment did come with dish soap, laundry soap, and bath soap.  There is also recycling in the building.  We provided our own trash bags by using the plastic bags from the grocery store, paper towels, and coffee (I think they may provide coffee but it just happened to be out, not sure as there were plenty of other things to drink like tea and hot chocolate).   My only minor complaint is that it only came with 1 roll of toilet paper for 4 people for 6 nights.   I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!",FALSE,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

Daena was really nice, she always made us find 2 bottles of fresh water when we came back from our long days and on the last day she even gave us a lift to the station :) I would recommend her 200%!",FALSE,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

To add to the beautiful home, Daena helped us with everything we needed and more (without exaggeration) with things like where to go, what to see, how to get there and even means of getting there! Then she was kind enough to help with looking for permanent residence and even found me a job. Daena is all you could ask from a host. 

Thank you Daena, Lily and Jack :)",FALSE,9,9,9,9,9,9,9
4856,4857,4882,8,"My fiancée and I enjoyed ourself during the New Year period. Roger's apartment is in a very central location in the district of King's Cross/Darlinghurst with many food, coffee and drinking locations within easy walking distance. The train from King's Cross takes you into the heart of the city just one stop away, and Central Station where you interchange to a direct line towards the airport. 

The apartment itself felt like home away from home. An extensive collection of artwork frames a very cozy carpeted apartment, with a balcony commanding unobstructed views over the surrounding neighborhoods and towards the direction of Bondi. The pool and the gym were some of the added benefits, and the pool deck provided a great vantage point of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, and from which to observe the New Year fireworks. A truly memorable trip and would highly recommend Roger's place.",FALSE,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

It is 5 mins to Kings Cross Station, also has a variety of supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and bars around and  having Fitness First nearby was a plus for me.

4860,4861,4886,8,"I had the good fortune of coming across Calvin's posting at short notice. Our correspondence was quick and fuss-free. Especially considering I was trying to sort out accommodation for my parents (alas, not I) to see in the new year in Sydney.

An accommodating host by all accounts. A central location, close to public transport. My folks (in their late 50s) found it pretty easily, which is saying something. Mum and Dad scored the master bedroom, in a clean and safe apartment. They mentioned it was a bit stuffy (no aircon) but it was a tradeoff from the road noise. To be fair, it's summer and I think they spent most of their time out and about anyhow.

Thanks Calvin!",FALSE,8,8,8,8,8,8,8
4861,4862,4887,9,"Me and my fiance Nick came to Sydney from Hong Kong for a yoga teacher training, and because Nick had stayed in Sydney for 12 years in his life so it's also for me to get to know his world, friends, families. For a trip like this,  I couldn't have asked for a better host!!! :D

Calvin has been very nice since day 1. Like the photo indicated, he wears a big smile almost all the time and that made us a feel very welcomed. Key collection and everything else logically has been super easy and effortless. Communication is clear and direct. No fuss at all. We arrived at the room with fresh towels and a lovely comfy bed waiting for us. The flat is filled with abundant day light and sunset view from the balcony is just great. Large windows, natural breeze. 

We were staying at the master bedroom with a private bathroom which was quite massive. (to Hong Kong standards) That provided us with a lot of privacy and space as we needed. Since we are in a full-time yoga teacher training with a 10-hour schedule from Monday-Friday ( 7am to 5pm) we really needed good night's sleep. I have not had one night of bad sleep which was AMAZING and helped sustain my energy for the whole course. 
I think largely  it's because Calvin's place is super homey. As soon as we entered the flat we noticed there is very minimal material objects or decor which is wonderful because it told us so much about his personality- easy going, straightforward, honest, and very very friendly. 

Me and Nick got a long with Calvin very very well because we shared common interests,m but also because he is just a great nice person. We even practiced yoga together; sometimes cooked together. ( i love his Chinese style fried rice as I was getting home-sick and missing Chinese food ) He is very open to chat and I am sure if we had asked, he could give us lot of space as well. But because we liked him so much basically every time he came home we just had to know what's going on with his day.

We stayed here for a whole month and it passed just like a blink of an eye. We have enjoyed every second we stayed here. We have a couple of day offs between courses and we're going to check out Byron before coming back to finish another workshop. And I am very happy to say we have made another booking to stay with Calvin again.

4862,4863,4888,8,"Me and my friend stayed with Calvin for just under a week. We had an unexpected last minute cancellation but Calvins speedy response meant that we were able to book it within a few minutes of finding it! 

Calvin was a really nice host, and welcomed us to his flat and made us feel at home. He helped us find local shops and gave us handy tips for Sydney (we're first time visitors). Calvin was also flexible and accommodating.  

We arrived to a clean room with super comfy bed bing freshly made with clean linen. The en-suite attached to the room gave us a certain amount of privacy which was an added bonus. The room has lots of storage space which allowed us to unpack and fully settle in. 

The location is superb, its a 5 minute walk from central station, and the bus stop outside gave us good access to central Sydney. It made getting around Sydney very easy. The only downside was that being on the main road with only a single glazed window means the room can get alot of noise from traffic.
